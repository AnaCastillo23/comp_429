STEPS ON HOW TO COMPILE PROGRAM AND RUN OUR APPLICATION:

1.  After downloading the project folder, open the Command Prompt in your system.

2.  Check that java is installed by typing "java -version".

    -If java is installed, you will see a message stating what version of Java is currently installed.
    -If not, you may need to install java.

3.   Navigate to the folder in which our project was saved.

    -Use the command "cd" followed by the directory name to change folders in the Command Prompt and press ENTER to navigate to that folder.
        An example path is C:\Users\Professor\Desktop\comp 429 project\comp 429 project files\src in order to find our chat.java file containing the project code.

4.  On the Command Prompt, type "javac chat.java" to compile the program.

5.  On the Command Prompt, type "java chat 29001" to run the program.

    -The listening port that our project uses is 29001, so this represents a command line argument that our project will use to run.
